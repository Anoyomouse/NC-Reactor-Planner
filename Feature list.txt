Drawing:
*Draw reactors up to 24x24x24.
    LMB places the block highlighted in the palette.
    RMB places Air (clears the block).
    MMB places a fuel cell.
*The above works with holding the button down and dragging over the grid.
*Coolers gain a red border if placement conditions aren't met.
*Precise errors are shown for such coolers in the block's tooltips.
*Layout can be toggled between showing one layer at a time or all layers side-by-side.
*Scale can be adjusted using the box in the top right.

Saving and export:
*Reactors can be saved/loaded to/from .json.
*Reactors can be exported as an image containing the full reactor layout and stats, this uses the scale set in the scale box.

Simulation:
*For a given layout the planner simulates it as per the mod's reactor code.
*A stats output is generated containing:
    Total number of interior blocks per type.
    Total number of casings needed to cover the outer layer.
    Total cooling generated per tick per cooler type.
    Total cooling, heat, heat difference generated per tick.
    Total energy generated per tick.
    Efficiency, heat multiplier.
*All blocks have a tooltip that shows extensive info about them.

Configuration:
*Cooler and fuel values are configurable.
*General fission reactor values are configurable.
*Default (vanills 2.11c) configuration is loaded on application start, you need to reload your config file every session for now, this is planned to improve in the next version.
*You can save/load your configuration settings to a separate file if you want to have (possibly multiple) non-default value sets. Check out the config menu.

Misc:
*There are tooltips for most ui elements and blocks.
*There are safeguards in place for large reactor UI stability.
*You'll get a warning if you don't have the required dependency .dll
